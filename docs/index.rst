Welcome to the DESI Data Model!

The DESI Data Tree
------------------

DESI data are grouped broadly by category, using environment variables to
define the base directory under which files of that category are kept.
These variables have a standard location relative to $DESI_ROOT, but code
uses these variables so that one can swap out different input/output locations
for testing.

   RVSpecfit output: rv_output <rv_output/index>

Imaging data and their catalogs are documented separately by the
`Legacy Survey <http://legacysurvey.org/>`_.
